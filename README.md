Instructions: Using HTML, CSS (preprocessor optional), a reactive framework of your choice and as few images as possible, create a page that implements the recording activity described below, and keep accessibility in mind for your design. Send us your completed solution together with the following within 2-3 business days for review:
•	Include instructions for how to run the project.
•	Include a brief writeup (just a couple paragraphs) of your approach and critique your work.
A recording activity
1.	A row of three round buttons. Inside each is a symbol: a square, a circle, and a triangle that points to the right. All three are the same size, have some space between them, and should align with each other along their centers. Above the buttons is “Say the vocabulary words.”
2.	Each button should have a different color. You can choose any colors you like, as long as the three are distinguishable from each other. There is a text label below each button: in order, “Stop”, “Record”, “Review your recording”.
3.	Below the buttons, a text area that is well-aligned to the set of buttons. This is for a student’s freeform answer based on earlier reading material
4.	A pair of radio buttons marked “true” and “false” to answer the question “Is this your final answer?” and a submit button that only submits if the radio button is set to “true”.
5.	Add focus & hover styles that render a 0.75em ring around the outside of the button.
6.	On narrow screen widths (350 and below), present the button group in a vertical configuration.
7.	Add some additional behaviors:

*The stop button should reset the state of the other two buttons.
* The play and review buttons should switch to an active state when clicked.
* When the “play” state is active and the stop” button is pressed, the text area should gain focus.
* No actual audio recording/playing required — the media could be mocked with a timer, but nothing more complicated than that is needed.
